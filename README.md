    - Analyzed customer repeat behavior, product preferences, and reorder intervals for business insights.
    - Delivered actionable summary tables and charts to support data-driven decision making.
    - Prophet model for time-series forecast

- [Stock Prediction]()
	- Collected and preprocessed historical stock price data for time series analysis for Meta.
	- Engineered features such as moving averages, RSI, and lagged returns to improve predictive performance.
	- Built LSTM and evaluated ARIMA machine learning models to forecast future stock prices.
	- Visualized predictions and model performance, providing actionable insights for investment strategies.

- [Sticker Sale Prediction](https://github.com/kukulauren/ml-kaggle/blob/main/sale_prediction/sticker-sale-prediction.ipynb)
    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sticker sales, including category distribution and temporal sales trends
    - Applied time series-aware feature engineering and categorical data handling
    - Visualized sales trends across time, such as monthly, weekly, and category-based patterns
    - Implemented model training and fine-tuning using K-Fold cross-validation
    - Evaluated and compared multiple regressors: CatBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor, and RandomForestRegressor
    
    
### 2. 3D segmentation models
Developed a complete 3D medical image segmentation pipeline using U-Net architecture. SAM, and YOLO for testing
- Built with PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TorchIO, and NiBabel.
- Trained to segment six classes: background, upper jaw, lower jaw, upper teeth, lower teeth, and artery.
- Dataset sourced from Asian patient CT scans.
- Integrated with a Hugging Face demo for live inference.
